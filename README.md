Module Learning Outcomes: 
This   assignment   is   designed to assess the   following   module   learning   outcomes. Your   submission   will   be   marked   using   the   Grading   Criteria   given   in the   section   below.
LO   1.   Demonstrate   knowledge   of   descriptive   statistics
LO   2.   Demonstrate   knowledge   of   hypothesis   testing

Assignment: 
This   assessment   constitutes   30%   of the total   evaluation for   the   module.   To gauge your current skills, you are   expected to complete   the   following   tasks.   An   electronic   copy   of   these   exercises should   be   submitted   as   required   using   Word or   any   other   appropriate   software package   (converting   it   into   PDF format   is   recommended).   The   cover   sheet should   include the title   "Statistics   Summary   Exercise   2023," along   with your   student   ID   number   and degree   programme.   Please   submit only one   file. 
You will   need the   Excel   worksheet titled   "Stock    Returns   Data   Sample   2023" to successfully complete this   exercise. This   can   be found on   Canvas.   Prepare   a   report   of   no   more   than   750   words   (tables   are   not   included   in the   word count)   that summarises the   investigated data. Your   work should   be   presented   clearly   and concisely,   utilising   as   many   mathematical techniques   as   possible   that   have   been covered this   term.
Tasks 
1.         Estimate the   descriptive   statistics   of the   data   for   both   companies   and the   index,   and   provide   commentary on various   statistics,    including   measures such as   mean, standard deviation,   skewness,   and   kurtosis.   (10   marks)
2.         Using   a   5% significance   level, test whether   a   significant difference   exists   in the   mean   returns   of the two   stocks,   GE   and AAPL. You   need   to show   the   details   of   how   you conduct   the   hypothesis   test.   (10   marks)
3.         Imagine you are   an   investment   manager   currently   holding   the   index.   Would these
two   stocks,   GE   and AAPL,   be   suitable   as target stocks for   diversifying   your   portfolio's   risk? Why?   (10   marks)
Grading Criteria / Marking Rubric 
Your   submission   will   be graded according   to the following   criteria:
This   is   a   quantitatively   based   assignment,   and your   ability to apply   mathematical   and statistical   methods   will   be   a   key   part of   the 代 写32427 Numeracy, Statistical Analysis & Financial Literacy B
代做程序编程语言  assessment. The following   criteria   will   be   used   to evaluate   your   work: 
1.         10   marks for   Task   1,   10   marks for   Task   2,   and   10   marks for   Task   3   (Total   30   marks).   Marks will   be   awarded   based on   how well   you address the   specific   requirements   of   each task.
2.       A good   report will   demonstrate   your    understanding    of   key   concepts,   theories,   and   knowledge   covered during   the   module.   Strong   responses   will   accurately   apply statistical   principles   and   mathematical   techniques   relevant to the   data.
3.       Support    your   discussion   with   relevant data   and statistical   evidence from   the   dataset   provided.   Clear   and correct   use   of   quantitative   data   is   essential,   and   interpretations   should   align with the   statistical   findings.
4.       The   report should   be well-organised   and   clearly   written,   with   logical   flow   between   sections.   Proper   formatting   of tables   is   expected,   along   with concise yet comprehensive   explanations   of your   findings.
5.         Demonstrate   critical   thinking   in your   quantitative   analysis. A strong   report will   go   beyond   basic   calculations,   offering   thoughtful   insights   and original   commentary, particularly   in Task   3, where you evaluate   portfolio diversification.
Ethical Use of Generative AI (GenAI) 
You are   permitted to   use   GenAIto support    your   submission   for   this   assessment.   You   may   use   it for   the following   activities:
•          Researching   and   refining   your   ideas
•          Information   retrieval   or   background   research
•          Drafting   an outline to organise   or   summarise your   thoughts
•          Refining   research questions
•         Checking   spelling   and   grammar
Applying   GenAI   tools should    be   done   with   human oversight and control.   You   should carefully   review and   use the   results   carefully   as AI   can generate   authoritative-sounding   output   that can   be   incorrect,   incomplete,   uncritical,   or   biased.
You   may   not submit   any work generated   by   an AI tool   as   your   own.   Where   you   include   any material generated by   an AI tool,   it should   be   properly   declared   just   like   any other   reference material. Alongside your   assignment you should also   provide   a   commentary   in the   Cover    Sheet   detailing   how   GenAI   has   been   used   to develop   your   final   submission. If you   have   not   used   GenAI tools,   you   should   clearly state   so. 
Plagiarism,   including   that which   results from   using   GenAI,   is   a   form   of   academic   misconduct   that will   be   dealt with   under   the   University’s   Code   of   Practice   on Academic   Integrity.
